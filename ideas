Pre processing.

to build the annotations on Kanji positions, create code that reads the manual Kanji masks and classifies the Kanji, then writes everything to a text file.




for postprocessing, 


- create code to combine masks (heatmap)

- make postprocess or evaluate file
	- receive the route of the results (txt boxes, binary masks) and of the original test set  
	- for the binary mask, use tooya's code to say how many where found "missed"
	- look for yolo code for map50... and do that with the boxes or masks

- test with images without noise reduction too
	
- implement leave one out 10 fold cross validation scheme

- How do we create a database for kanji classification ?
	- Ideally, use the same characters. Can we define what those characters are?
	-
