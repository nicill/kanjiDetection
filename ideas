for postprocessing, 

- Make test file output binary mask files and coordinate files too

- create code to combine masks (heatmap

- make postprocess or evaluate file
	- receive the route of the results (txt boxes, binary masks) and of the original test set  
	- for the binary mask, use tooya's code to say how many where found "missed"
	- look for yolo code for map50... and do that with the boxes or masks

- test with images without noise reduction too
	
- implement leave one out 10 fold cross validation scheme
